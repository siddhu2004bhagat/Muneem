# Palm Rejection System

## Overview

The MUNEEM app now includes a sophisticated **3-Tier Palm Rejection System** optimized for capacitive touchscreens (like the Waveshare 10.1" DSI) that don't have active digitizers.

## The Problem

Capacitive touchscreens cannot distinguish between:
- **Stylus tip** (small touch blob)
- **Fingertip** (medium touch blob)  
- **Palm/Wrist** (large touch blob)

Without palm rejection, resting your hand while writing creates unwanted marks.

## Solution: 3-Tier System

### Tier 1: Immediate Size-Based Rejection ⚡
**What it does:** Instantly rejects touches that are too large to be a stylus.

**How it works:**
- Measures `width` and `height` of touch contact area
- If `max(width, height) > threshold` (default: 30px), reject immediately
- Optional: Reject touches in bottom 15% of screen (palm rest zone)

**Performance:** Zero latency, happens before stroke begins.

### Tier 2: Temporal Delay Analysis ⏱️
**What it does:** Waits briefly to see if a smaller touch (stylus) appears.

**How it works:**
1. When a touch arrives, queue it for 40ms instead of drawing immediately
2. If a **smaller** touch appears during this window, the first touch was likely a palm → reject it
3. If no other touch appears, accept and begin stroke after 40ms

**Why this works:** Humans naturally rest their palm *before* or *simultaneously* with the stylus tip touching.

**Trade-off:** Adds 40ms latency to stroke start (imperceptible for most users).

### Tier 3: Velocity Analysis 📊
**What it does:** Monitors movement after stroke begins.

**How it works:**
1. Track total movement for first 100ms of stroke
2. If touch is large (>24px) AND has moved less than 2px total → likely a stationary palm
3. Cancel the stroke mid-drawing

**Why this works:** Styluses move quickly when writing. Palms are relatively stationary.

## Configuration

### Default Settings
```typescript
{
  sizeThreshold: 30,              // px - touches larger than this are palms
  temporalDelayMs: 40,            // ms - wait time for stylus detection
  velocityThreshold: 2,           // px - minimum movement in 100ms to be "writing"
  edgeRejectionZone: 0.15,        // 15% - bottom edge zone (disabled by default)
  enableTemporalDelay: true,      // Enable Tier 2
  enableVelocityAnalysis: true,   // Enable Tier 3
  enableEdgeFiltering: false      // Disable edge zone by default
}
```

### Customizing Settings

#### Option 1: In PenCanvas Component
```typescript
import { usePointerEvents } from './hooks/usePointerEvents';

const { onPointerDown, onPointerMove, onPointerUp } = usePointerEvents(
  {
    getPosition,
    beginStroke,
    extendStroke,
    endStroke,
  },
  {
    enablePalmRejection: true,
    debugPalmRejection: false, // Set to true for console logging
    palmRejection: {
      sizeThreshold: 35,        // More aggressive rejection
      temporalDelayMs: 50,      // Longer delay for better accuracy
      enableEdgeFiltering: true // Enable bottom-edge rejection
    }
  }
);
```

#### Option 2: Environment-Based Configuration
For Waveshare-specific tuning, you could add to your `.env`:

```bash
VITE_PALM_SIZE_THRESHOLD=35
VITE_PALM_TEMPORAL_DELAY=50
VITE_PALM_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD=3
```

Then read in your component:
```typescript
const palmConfig = {
  sizeThreshold: Number(import.meta.env.VITE_PALM_SIZE_THRESHOLD) || 30,
  temporalDelayMs: Number(import.meta.env.VITE_PALM_TEMPORAL_DELAY) || 40,
  velocityThreshold: Number(import.meta.env.VITE_PALM_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD) || 2,
};
```

## Debugging

Enable debug mode to see rejection events in console:

```typescript
const config = {
  debugPalmRejection: true
};
```

You'll see logs like:
```
[PalmRejection] Immediate rejection: Size 45.2px exceeds threshold 30px
[PalmRejection] Pointer accepted after delay: 123
[PalmRejection] Velocity rejection: Stationary large touch (1.2px movement in 120ms)
```

## Tuning for Your Hardware

### If you get too many false rejections (stylus strokes rejected):
1. **Increase** `sizeThreshold` to 35-40px
2. **Decrease** `temporalDelayMs` to 30ms
3. **Disable** `enableVelocityAnalysis`

### If palms still get through:
1. **Decrease** `sizeThreshold` to 25px
2. **Increase** `temporalDelayMs` to 50-60ms
3. **Enable** `enableEdgeFiltering` if you rest your palm at the bottom

### For very slow writing (calligraphy):
1. **Increase** `velocityThreshold` to 5-10px
2. **Disable** `enableVelocityAnalysis` (Tier 3)

## Performance Impact

| Tier | CPU Impact | Latency Impact |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Tier 1 (Size) | Negligible (~0.1ms) | 0ms |
| Tier 2 (Temporal) | Low (~0.5ms) | +40ms to stroke start |
| Tier 3 (Velocity) | Low (~0.2ms per move) | 0ms |

**Total overhead:** ~1ms per pointer event (imperceptible on Raspberry Pi 4/5).

## Backward Compatibility

The system is **fully backward compatible**. If you don't pass a config, it defaults to:
- Enhanced palm rejection: **Enabled**
- Debug logging: **Disabled**
- All tiers: **Enabled**

To disable entirely (use old behavior):
```typescript
const config = {
  enablePalmRejection: false
};
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Write slowly with stylus → strokes appear correctly
- [ ] Write quickly with stylus → strokes appear correctly
- [ ] Rest palm while writing → no palm marks
- [ ] Rest palm *before* writing → no palm marks
- [ ] Two-finger scroll → canvas scrolls, no drawing
- [ ] Finger drawing (if enabled) → works normally
- [ ] Edge cases: corners, edges, rapid strokes

## Known Limitations

1. **No Active Stylus Support**: This system is designed for *passive* styluses on capacitive screens. If you have an active digitizer (like Wacom), the browser's native palm rejection is better.

2. **40ms Latency**: Tier 2 adds a small delay. For professional artists who need zero latency, you can disable it:
   ```typescript
   palmRejection: { enableTemporalDelay: false }
   ```

3. **Very Light Touch**: If your stylus has a very light touch (similar size to a palm), you may need to tune `sizeThreshold` carefully.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Machine Learning Model**: Train a lightweight decision tree on user's writing patterns
2. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Auto-tune based on detected stylus size
3. **User Calibration**: Let users draw a test stroke to calibrate their stylus
4. **Pressure Sensitivity**: Use pressure data (if available) to distinguish stylus from palm

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Enable `debugPalmRejection: true`
2. Check console logs for rejection reasons
3. Adjust thresholds based on your hardware
4. Report persistent issues with device specs and debug logs
